# Ducker

This is Ducker, a Twitter inspired social media made for my final project of this year.

If you want to be able to use the app in a complete way, you should clone the [API](https://github.com/Dominguezd01/duckerAPI "API repo") repository.

## Developing

First you have to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dominguezd01/Ducker.git
```

Go to the directory

```bash
cd Ducker
```

Install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally you can run the following commands depending on what you want:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
